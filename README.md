# RentEasy

## Introduction
RentEasy is a web application designed to streamline the process of managing rental properties for landlords and finding rental properties for tenants. It provides a user-friendly platform for listing properties, searching for rentals, and facilitating communication between landlords and tenants.

## Inspiration and Vision
The inspiration for RentEasy came from my own struggles in finding rental properties. I realized that many existing platforms were cumbersome and lacked user-friendly features. My goal was to create a seamless experience that addressed these pain points.

For the future, I envision RentEasy evolving into a comprehensive property management tool that includes features such as automated rent collection, maintenance tracking, and analytics to help landlords make informed decisions.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions
One of the most challenging aspects of this project was designing and implementing the database architecture. The goal was to create a scalable, secure, and responsive database capable of handling diverse and dynamic data structures. Here's a detailed look at how I tackled this challenge:

## Situation
We needed a robust database to manage user profiles, property listings, rental applications, and messages. The database had to support complex queries and ensure data integrity and security.

## Task
Design and implement a PostgreSQL database integrated with Django that could handle dynamic queries and maintain performance as the dataset grew.

## Action
    1. Schema design: I designed a flexible schema with appropriate foreign key relationships to ensure referential integrity. The schema was normalized to reduce redundancy but also denormalized where necessary for performance optimization.

    2. Indexing and Optimization: I added indexes to frequently queried fields and optimized the database by analyzing query execution plans and adjusting as needed. This helped in significantly improving the query performance.

    3. Partitioning: To handle large datasets efficiently, I partitioned tables based on criteria such as location and price range. This reduced the amount of data scanned during queries, improving performance.

    4. Caching: Implemented caching using Djangoâ€™s caching framework and Redis to store results of frequently run queries, thereby reducing load on the database.

## Result
The result was a highly optimized and secure database architecture that supported efficient data storage and retrieval. The performance improvements were evident, with search queries returning results quickly and write operations maintaining acceptable speeds.
